*Yuelin Bay, by The Anonymous Bard.* 

I came to Yuelin Bay after the mists cleared and got to know its streets slowly, yard by yard. It was the spring before I got my true education, before The Sou-Westers really made their name and before a summer of lanterns over Main Street. 

Mount Yuelin watches impassively over the bay, rising shallow at first, away from the town, then in steep rocky outcroppings. It is strewn with firs, ferns and bumpy blankets of moss-covered ground. It is veined with the desire paths of beasts and critters. A road runs from the town up the hill but is quickly lost, marking the point beyond which locals do not go. They have the good sense to fear the skulking beasts, ancient ghosts and smugglers, who use those shaded routes for their work. If you must go that way, go with some foresters or a ranger who knows the safe places. 

Atop the mount is Thornclasp Forest, an old husk of wood. It’s a cantankerous place and, all agree, a place to be avoided. Though, recently, there is easy money to be made taking tourists with a death wish to lay a careful toe across its charred threshold. You might have heard it called Kuzu, and that name might conjure bedtime stories your mother told you about ancient druids. I can confirm, like so many things in our land, those stories are true. 

*At this point, a less scrupulous bard might be tempted into a digression about The Sou-Westers and about how so much changed in such a short time after their arrival; but I won’t be drawn into that old game here.* 

Kohaku flows happily from the peak, gurgling over rocks and winding its way down to the bay, until eventually it hums an endless tune into the silence of The Still Sea. After the mists cleared, it became a lively highway for salmon, crayfish, freshwater shrimp and all manner of water spinach. Some call it Koku, but I’ve always preferred the traditional name. 

Now - to the town itself. 

It is home to around two thousand decent souls and, street by street, it lays a net onto the slope that leads steadily downward to The Still Sea. Timber buildings on shallow stone foundations layer themselves neatly between lanes of trodden dirt. If you were to enter by the north road, you’d come by The Common and to Main Street with its shops and stall fronts and The Ploughman’s Guild and all the activity of trade on market day. If the sun was out, barking dogs and screaming children would slip like fish between stalls in a good natured search for scraps or penny-work. If you were early, you’d catch the stench of mules and oiled armour as foresters and rangers saddled up and gathered their tools for a foray into the woods. 

You could do some shopping. You would find books, potions, armament, fast food (I recommend the trout pies) and all manner of other curios. Above all you would notice an abundance of furniture, cookware, toys and other wooden goods; finely finished, sanded smooth and distributed in shop windows throughout town. It’s a place of expert woodworkers. Indeed, I am told that Selan Archetier herself hailed from these parts, though she eventually took her talent for bow craft to New Veyrac. 

West of the main road, and away from Kohaku, you might stroll down open lanes by finely built houses, each with a herb garden and personal well. You’d be carried down Bakers Lane on the warm waft of buns and spiced pastry. You would pass shrines to ancestors and family gods, and eventually you'd reach suburbs of tradecraft; pockets of land devoted variously to: carving, coopering, joinery, engraving, bookbinding, alchemy, mapmaking and all the comparatively ‘clean’ trades that don’t cause a stink. 
 
Further west you’d find a steep hill up to the Du Lac estate which overlooks the town as a whole. I have not had the fortune to visit that manor house and have often peered through its iron gates, guessing at the history that has been written there. 

East and south of the main road you would walk parallel to the river through a tangle of buildings. Here and there you’d hear water flowing down low stone ducts, through houses, before returning to Kohaku’s clean embrace. You might notice women and children weaving, preparing meals or making oaths. Through a narrow window you might spy a mother teaching her daughter how to make lanterns, so that she might adopt that solemn tradition in her later years.

On the other side of the river, set back some distance, you’ll find the tanners, blacksmiths, loggers, brewers and shipwrights. You might hear a distant clatter but on most days, you’d need to cross Southbridge to get a full whiff of those workshops or the farmsteads beyond. 

As you reach the bottom of the hill, the main road regathers its sprawl to meet at the docks. A promenade of activity for hard men. Men with no mind for trade but who, instead, work with hooks, bait and muscle. Those who haul barrels two at a time while smoking a pipe and swearing heartily. The kind of men who need a half dozen drinking holes to fill the thirst of a good days work. You'll find The Rusty Anchor, which you may have heard of in many blue tunes sung around these parts (many of which take advantage of the useful rhymes it provides, and many of which, I confess, I have written). 

If you’re not a local, you’d be advised to shut your nose entering the docks. The fish and sweat and damp can get in the lungs and cling on for days. If you’re a sensitive soul, you might want to shut your ears too. And for gods sake don’t look at a sailor wrong or say a slanted word. In fact, I’d advise keeping everything shut wherever possible.
