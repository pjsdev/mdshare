## Pricelist

- For **items** and **consumables**, tiers are indicated by the number range on the roll table in the rulebook.

- **Unique items** are non-consumables that are not in the book that have novel and unique effects. They could be armour, weapons or anything else.

Below are the **lowest possible purchase** prices. No self-respecting merchant will ever sell for lower than this.

## Crafting

During downtime you can work on crafting as a long term project. 

### Target Type & Tier

The first thing to do is figure out the **Tier** and **Type** of the item you are making. Consult the cost price table above to figure out an item type and tier. If you want to make something special and invented, then it's probably a unique item. 

> For example:
> 
> If you are making a Major Health Potion, that would be a Tier 4 Consumable. 
> If you are making a Self Tying Shoe Laces, that's a Tier 1 Unique Item.

###### Pitching Unique Items

If you want to craft something from an 'essence', you can pitch the GM an idea for an item and work with them to place an appropriate tier and item type for the project. 

### Materials

Next, identify the materials needed to make the thing. Common materials are assumed to be easy to find, but some items might need something novel or the essence of a magical creature (see below). These details are worked out at the table by you and the GM. 

> For example:
> 
> A Major Health Potion might need a certain flower
> Self Tying Shoe Laces might need a sprinkle of fairy dust

##### Monster Essences

Some monsters might have an 'essence' that could be used in crafting, like dragon scales, a giants bones or the heart of a Griffon. Mundane adversaries like humanoid bandits will not have an 'essence'.
###### Discover the Essence

When you encounter a monster, you may **Roll Knowledge** against their adversary difficulty 
number, to learn whether they have an 'essence' and what it is. 
###### Harvest the Essence

When you slay a monster whose essence you know about, you may **Roll Finesse** against their adversary difficulty number, to safely harvest it.

### Gold for Sundries

Some crafting projects logically require sundries. Work with the GM to identify if your project does. If it does, you need approximately half the cost price of the item to cover sundries. 

> For example
> 
> A Tier 1 Item requires 1 coin to cover sundries
> A Tier 4 Unique Item requires 1 chest of coins to cover sundries

### In Fiction Expertise

Your character must be able to make the thing they're trying to make, or have access to a willing labourer; if you want to make a Tier 2 weapon, you need access to a 'Tier 2 Weaponsmith'. 

Some examples might be:
 
> Weaponsmith
> Armoursmith
> Tinkerer (non magical item making)
> Enchanter
> Alchemist
> etc....

#### Learning a Skill

You can teach yourself the expertise by completing a long term project during downtime. If an expert is teaching you or you have a relevant learning aid, gain advantage on the rolls. 

|                | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 | Tier 4 |
| -------------- | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| **Countdown**  |   6    |   12   |   18   |   24   |
| **Difficulty** |   12   |   14   |   16   |   18   |

> For example:
> 
> If you want to learn to be a Tier 2 Weaponsmith, you must have learned Tier 1, then complete a 12 Countdown with Difficulty 14.

##### Learning by Doing

In addition to 'consciously learning' a skill. Every item you craft, contributes ticks equal to the item's tier to the next tier's expertise. 

> For example:
> 
> You craft your first Tier 2 Weapon. Your 'Tier 3 Weaponsmith' countdown advances to 2/18.

#### Paid Labour

Alternatively, you can hire help. Standard pay for skilled labour is around **1/3 the cost price of the item** you're making. Once paid, you are able to roll downtime as if you had the expertise *just for that item*.

### Crafting Countdown

Each item Type & Tier takes a different length of time. Consult the table below to see how long the project will take. The GM might shift this up or down contextually. If your expertise is higher than the item tier you are making, you get advantage on the rolls. 

|                 |    Tier 1    |    Tier 2    |    Tier 3    |    Tier 4    |
| --------------- | :----------: | :----------: | :----------: | :----------: |
| **Consumable**  | 4 countdown  | 6 countdown  | 8 countdown  | 10 countdown |
| **Item**        | 6 countdown  | 9 countdown  | 12 countdown | 15 countdown |
| **Armament**    | 10 countdown | 12 countdown | 15 countdown | 18 countdown |
| **Unique Item** | 10 countdown | 12 countdown | 15 countdown | 20 countdown |
|                 |              |              |              |              |
| **Difficulty**  |    **12**    |    **14**    |    **16**    |    **18**    |
###### Outcomes

- **Critical Success**: 4 ticks
- **Success with hope**: 3 ticks
- **Success with fear**: 2 ticks
- **Failure:** 1 tick

## Full Example

Timotheth Longfellow the Bard recently slew The Rat King and gathered its essence: 'The Rat King's Tails'. He wants to make a magical item called 'The Rat Goblet'. A goblet that, with a trigger-word, turns into a rat that obeys basic commands. He pitches it to the GM, who suggests it's a Tier 2 Unique Item. Timotheth is a Tier 1 Enchanter and decides to learn more about the craft. He creates a 12 Countdown on his character sheet to track it. The GM tells him to fill in 3 ticks of the countdown immediately because he has already made 3 tier 1 enchanted items. 

On his next long rest, Timotheth rolls Knowledge as he reads a book on enchanting. Because he has the book, he gets advantage. He rolls a 15 with fear, the GM takes fear and Timotheth fills in 2 more ticks of his 12 Countdown. 

After he becomes a Tier 2 Enchanter, he begins a 9 Countdown to make The Rat Goblet. He removes 1 bag of coin from his inventory for sundries. Once he has completed the item, he removes The Rat King's Tails from his inventory and adds Rat Goblet.
