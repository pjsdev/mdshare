The Magus is the grand unifier of spellcraft — one who marries raw talent with perfect study. To a Magus, magic is both art and equation, intuition and law. They move through the weave of the world as easily as others draw breath, shaping the rules that bind magic itself. Some twist time and consequence, unmaking moments or weaving new threads in their place. Others embrace the ungovernable chaos within magic’s heart, surrendering to the unpredictable powers that pulse beneath all reality.
